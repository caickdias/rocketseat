#App for scheduling meetings for playing together via Discord

This project was a code-along app that I created following Rocketseat videos at their 'next-level-week'.

It helped me a lot having a better understanding of tons of RN concepts and mobile-app design.
It has nice features like signIn with Discord account, api fetching for looking into your discords servers and sending invites. Also, we used hooks, API context, fonts importing, navigation, routing and a lot componentizing and folder structure concepts.

Thanks RocketSeat for this opportunity.
