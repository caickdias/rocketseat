#App for scheduling meetings and playing together via Discord using Expo

This project was a code-along app that I created following Rocketseat videos at their 'next-level-week'.

It helped me a lot having a better understanding of tons of RN concepts and mobile-app design.
It has nice features like login via Discord, api calls for looking into your discords servers and sending invites. Also, we used hooks, API context, fonts importing, navigation, routing and a lot componentizing, folder structure concepts and more. Still has some minor bugs.

Thanks RocketSeat for this opportunity.
